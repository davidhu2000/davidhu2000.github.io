In my prior [post](/blog/first-post-on-my-new-blog), I detailed my experience of rebuilding my site using Astro. Now, I want to do some actual comparisons between old and new performance. I ran lighthouse on both and here are the results.

### Light House Configurations

For both tests, I used the same lighthouse configurations

- Mode: Navigation
- Device: Mobile
- Categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, PWA

I also made sure to run the test in incognito mode to avoid extensions such as React DevTools affecting the results.

### Light House Scores

I'd like to note these scores are a bit skewed as I removed the projects section which included a lot of unoptimized images/gifs, which are all loaded the moment the page loads.

#### Category Scores

| Category       | Old | New |
| -------------- | --: | --: |
| Performance    |  48 |  99 |
| Accessibility  |  81 |  98 |
| Best Practices |  83 |  92 |
| SEO            |  92 | 100 |

#### Metrics

| Metric                   |   Old |   New |
| ------------------------ | ----: | ----: |
| First Contentful Paint   |  2.4s |  1.6s |
| Speed Index              |  4.3s |  1.6s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 12.5s |  1.6s |
| Time to Interactive      | 10.3s |  1.6s |
| Total Blocking Time      | 160ms |   0ms |
| Cumulative Layout Shift  | 0.432 | 0.001 |

Here are some [good docs](https://web.dev/learn-core-web-vitals/) on what these metrics mean.

The old site loads around 125kb worth of javascript, whereas the new site loads almost none: the only javascript file being google analytics. This is the reason why `First Contentful Paint` is the same as `Time to Interactive` since it's purely HTML.

AstroJS is a huge part of the performance gain, but also reworking/optimizing the site using the latest recommendations helped as well.

In any case, the numbers are just:

import { Picture } from "@astrojs/image/components";
import { SITE } from "../../config";

<Picture
  src={"/blog/comparing-performance-between-old-new-sites/wow.webp"}
  widths={[640]}
  aspectRatio={"4:3"}
  sizes=""
  alt="WOW!"
  formats={SITE.imageFormats}
/>
